This is a tutorial for using self-compiled builds of the GnuTLS-library for iOS. You can build apps with XCode and the official SDK from Apple with this. I also made a small example-app for using the libraries with XCode and the iPhone/iPhone-Simulator.

@see: http://www.x2on.de/2011/02/01/gnutls-for-ios-iphone-and-ipad/

Enjoy GnuTLS on the iPhone!

The examples uses the MD5-algorithm to calculate an md5 from an UITextfield.
